# React
There's going to be three branch for each plan with following tasks. 
Each branch are going to be named after the plan eg. "Plan A" and will contain a readme file with task for the following plan. 

## Plan A

## Plan C

**React Native**

React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities.

**React Navigation**

React Navigation's stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens and manage navigation history. If your app uses only one stack navigator then it is conceptually similar to how a web browser handles navigation state - your app pushes and pops items from the navigation stack as users interact with it, and this results in the user seeing different screens.

A key difference between how this works in a web browser and in React Navigation is that React Navigation's stack navigator provides the gestures and animations that you would expect on Android and iOS cd when navigating between routes in the stack.

**RN Firebase**

React Native Firebase is the officially recommended collection of packages that brings React Native support for all Firebase services on both Android and iOS apps.
